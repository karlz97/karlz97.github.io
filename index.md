Hi! This is Karl Zhang.
I love coding, rock climbing and cooking. 

I'm a Master's student in Industrial Engineering at Purdue University. I received my undergraduate degree in Computation Mathematics from Ocean University of China and am pround of being the first batch of students of [Xingyuan College](http://xysy.ouc.edu.cn/main.htm). 

I am passionate about building things. My current focus is on software development, machine learning and operations research. I am still new to software development and machine learning, both of which I am trying to teach myself. My Master's research is exploring the possibility of using drones to lift the efficiency of meal delivery.

Besides, I also have a wide interest in sociology, history and anthropology.
